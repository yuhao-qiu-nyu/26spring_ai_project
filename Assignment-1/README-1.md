## Science Guessing Game

> "This project aims to foster independent learning through AI interaction."

### 🎯 Target Age Group

Middle School Students (Grades 6-8 / Ages 11-14)

Reasoning: At this developmental stage, students are transitioning from concrete to abstract thinking. They are learning to classify matter and understand physical laws, which aligns perfectly with a structured inquiry-based game.

### 🧪 Content

Physical Science: Physics & Chemistry

Scope: The game covers chemical elements (The Periodic Table), states of matter, Newtonian mechanics (Force, Motion), and fundamental physical properties (Density, Conductivity).

### 🎮 Project Rationale

While I considered other interactive modes, I decided to stick with the **Guessing Game** format specifically because of the nature of Science (Physics & Chemistry).

Precision and Logic: Unlike humanities, scientific concepts are defined by high precision and rigid classification. The 20-question format forces students to use categorical thinking (e.g., "Is it a noble gas?" or "Is it a vector quantity?").

The Power of "Yes/No" in Science: In science, most properties are binary or factual (e.g., Is it a metal? Is it solid at room temperature?). This guessing format perfectly mirrors the scientific method—forming a hypothesis and testing it through structured inquiry.

Effective Scaffolding: For middle schoolers, a completely open-ended conversation can sometimes lead to "hallucinations" or vague learning. A goal-oriented guessing game provides a clear boundary, ensuring that the student stays focused on the specific physical and chemical attributes of the target concept.

### 📖 Teaching Method

This project utilizes Inquiry-Based Learning through a "Gamified Deduction" approach:

Active Inquiry: Instead of passive reading, students must actively recall and apply scientific knowledge to formulate strategic questions.

Constraint-Led Learning: The limit on questions (or the goal of guessing correctly) forces students to prioritize "high-value" scientific categories (e.g., asking about "state of matter" before "specific name").

Scaffolding: The AI acts as a mentor that provide hints or corrective feedback, helping students bridge the gap between their current knowledge and the target concept.
