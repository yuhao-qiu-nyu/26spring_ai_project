### 1. Rationale for Game Mechanics

While I considered other interactive modes, I decided to stick with the **Guessing Game** format specifically because of the nature of Science (Physics & Chemistry). 

Precision and Logic: Unlike humanities, scientific concepts are defined by high precision and rigid classification. The 20-question format forces students to use categorical thinking (e.g., "Is it a noble gas?" or "Is it a vector quantity?").

The Power of "Yes/No" in Science: In science, most properties are binary or factual (e.g., Is it a metal? Is it solid at room temperature?). This guessing format perfectly mirrors the Scientific Method—forming a hypothesis and testing it through structured inquiry.

Effective Scaffolding: For middle schoolers, a completely open-ended conversation can sometimes lead to "hallucinations" or vague learning. A goal-oriented guessing game provides a clear boundary, ensuring that the student stays focused on the specific physical and chemical attributes of the target concept.
